This code is an implementation of the Black-Scholes price for several financial derivatives. 

It's pretty simple, but the goal is to develop an object oriented approach to vanilla options, which can be recycled for use in more complicated projects. 

The formulas are checked for consistency, and validated using Monte Carlo. 

The code runs a python script to make a plot of the price of a European call as a function of strike.
That plot is saved as call_pricing.pdf
